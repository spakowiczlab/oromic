### Study overview
This protocol is designed to prospectively collect oropharyngeal swab samples and clinical data from Head and Neck cancer patients treated at the Radiation Oncology Department of The Ohio State University during the period of 07/2020-07/2023.

This is a prospective protocol targeting patients that will undergone definitive chemoradiation (not including immunotherapy) for treatment of oropharyngeal Head and Neck cancer (squamous cell carcinoma and no other histologies). This is a non-therapeutic study focused on prospective acquisition of oropharyngeal swabs and clinical data, to analyze clinical outcomes and toxicity in these patients. The data will be utilized to determine oncologic outcomes and toxicity in relation to oropharyngeal microbiome.
